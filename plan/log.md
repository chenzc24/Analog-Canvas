  release-only command; ordinary release contracts retain package generation,
  smoke, and production checks without binding development output to the last
  published asset.
- Validation: focused integrity contract (5 tests); MCP package; static
  contracts; test-impact; and full `pnpm ci:check` (including browser and
  release verification) passed locally. GitHub Actions also passed static
  (26s), unit (41s), release (55s), and browser shards (3m 18s / 3m 54s).
- Commit status: PR #131 merged to `main` as `701465ef`.

## 2026-08-20 - Unified bound text system

- Changed areas: single-source bindings for instance, Net/power, and Cell Port
  displays; shared annotation text resolution in render, bounds, hit testing,
  diagnostics, connectivity, copy/paste, hierarchy, and editing; compact
  RichText toolbar additions; and semantic Net-label rename preservation.
- Validation: focused unit contracts (12 files / 87 tests); focused browser
  contracts for semantic edits, movable Net labels, and Cell Ports;
  test-impact; and `pnpm verify:branch` (158 files / 945 tests, build, and
  production smoke) passed.
- Commit status: committed as `d4a22fbc` on `codex/unified-text-binding`.

## 2026-08-20 - Bound text editor repair

- Changed areas: semantic labels now use a direct single-line source editor;
  literal RichText uses deterministic line-break insertion and renders overbars
  inside its editing surface.
- Validation: focused browser regression (2 tests), workspace typecheck,
  test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: prepared on `codex/unified-text-binding`.

## 2026-08-20 - Schematic reference text

- Changed areas: added the user-owned RichText `Instance.schematicName` and
  typed edit; instance labels and Properties now edit that source rather than
  the SPICE reference; restored label formatting; and made multi-character
  overbar application reversible.
- Validation: 49 focused unit/protocol tests, 3 focused browser tests,
  workspace typecheck, test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: prepared on `codex/unified-text-binding`.

## 2026-08-20 - Phase 2 structural netlist closure

- Changed areas: completed editor delivery of the existing structural SPICE
  import/export loop with File-menu downloads and preflight preview for SPICE
  and Spectre; retained external master terminal identity/direction and open
  raw library parameters; added Project -> SPICE -> Project hierarchy/external
  call semantic round-trip coverage; clarified the no-PDK/no-simulation-deck
  boundary in user and export-contract documentation.
- Validation: focused unit contracts (4 files / 28 tests), workspace
  typecheck/build, focused Playwright preflight/preview/download flow (3
  tests), format, Markdown-link (117 docs), test-impact, and diff checks
  passed.
- Commit status: prepared on `codex/phase2-netlist-closure`.

## 2026-08-21 - Phase 2 structural netlist hardening

- Changed areas: preserved defaulted Cell formal parameters across SPICE
  import and SPICE/Spectre export; made formal terminal names authoritative in
  emitted Cell headers; represented explicit NoConnects with stable floating
  nodes and warning acknowledgement; normalized DC sources; upgraded the
  round-trip proof to a real Project semantic comparison; and added successful
  browser import-to-export coverage.
- Validation: focused changed contracts (6 files / 40 tests), complete SPICE
  and netlist package suites (10 files / 42 tests), workspace typecheck/build,
  focused browser flows (5 tests), format, docs, test-impact, and diff checks
  passed. Branch verification also reproduced two unrelated schema-15 baseline
  failures on the parent branch.
- Commit status: prepared on `codex/phase2-netlist-hardening`.

## 2026-08-21 - Schema 15 baseline reconciliation

- Changed areas: aligned ADR 0026 and the user compatibility guide with the
  accepted schema-15/schema-14 window, and moved the browser recovery
  compatibility regression from retired schema 13 to active schema 14.
- Validation: focused documentation/recovery tests (2 files / 25 tests), docs,
  test-impact and diff checks; complete branch verification passed (159 files /
  956 tests, workspace build, and production preview smoke).
- Commit status: prepared on `codex/phase2-netlist-hardening` as a separate
  baseline-reconciliation commit.

## 2026-08-21 - Phase 2 netlist mainline integration

- Changed areas: fast-forwarded local `main` from `14fe2d54` through the
  Phase 2 structural closure (`88a997df`), netlist hardening (`8d62fe21`), and
  schema-15 baseline reconciliation (`e11de334`); recorded the local
  integration boundary.
- Validation: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and complete `pnpm ci:check`
  passed: static contracts, 159 unit-test files / 956 tests, workspace build,
  release and production smoke checks, and 162 browser E2E tests.
- Commit status: merged to `origin/main` through PR #134 as `51075420` after
  all GitHub Actions checks passed; local `main` is synchronized.

## 2026-08-21 - Schema 16 instance identity protocol

- Changed areas: advanced canonical Projects to schema 16; split ambiguous
  instance labels into designator, schematic-name and master-name bindings;
  replaced the rolling reader with a direct schema-15 migration; synchronized
  recovery, fixtures, bundled examples, documentation, and ADR 0030.
- Validation: focused model/project-protocol/derived/editor contracts (12 files
  / 102 tests), typecheck, format, docs, test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux` as
  `d70c84bc`.

## 2026-08-21 - Unified instance display authoring

- Changed areas: introduced a shared editor display factory; made manual
  device, Cell, external-call and formal-Port labels category-correct; persisted
  insertion references; separated Reference and Alias in Properties; and added
  explicit ID/Reference/Alias/Master columns to Instance Table.
- Validation: focused unit contracts (7 files / 25 tests), focused Playwright
  flows (4 tests), typecheck, format, docs, test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux` as
  `0da8da3c`.

## 2026-08-21 - Instance placement lifecycle engine

- Changed areas: added explicit retained-unplaced transaction semantics and a
  shared lifecycle planner; selection deletion now clears route endpoints,
  memberships, NoConnects, labels, and unlocked layout references safely
  before strict instance removal.
- Validation: focused lifecycle/transaction/protocol/selection/Agent contracts
  (5 files / 56 tests), typecheck, format, docs, MCP-resource freshness,
  test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux` as
  `c2295d6e`.

## 2026-08-21 - Placement Tray controls

- Changed areas: replaced the bare unplaced list with a semantic Placement
  Tray; added single cursor placement, deterministic Place all, Return to tray,
  Return all, and a clear permanent-delete distinction.
- Validation: focused tray/interaction/connectivity/lifecycle contracts (4
  files / 24 tests), focused browser tray flow, typecheck, format, docs,
  test-impact, diff checks, and complete `pnpm verify:branch` passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux` as
  `13ba3a26`.

## 2026-08-21 - Schematic reference and unified Port lifecycle

- Changed areas: advanced canonical Projects to schema 17; separated the
  visible `Instance.schematicReference` from emitted netlist references;
  migrated schema 16 deterministically; made References visible by default;
  and made formal Cell Ports returnable and re-placeable without changing
  their interface semantics.
- Validation: focused unit contracts (17 files / 172 tests), targeted
  regression tests (2 files / 14 tests), formal-Port browser lifecycle (1
  test), format, docs, test-impact, diff checks, complete workspace unit-test
  execution, workspace build, and production preview smoke passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux` as
  the current branch HEAD.

## 2026-08-21 - Imported Reference default display

- Changed areas: made Tray placement, canvas drag/drop, and Place all
  materialize only missing default Reference projections; retained imported
  netlist references are now visibly rendered when first placed.
- Validation: focused editor contracts (3 files / 18 tests), SPICE
  import-and-place browser regression (1 test), typecheck, format,
  test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux` as
  the current branch HEAD.

## 2026-08-21 - Rich schematic label authority and formal Port presentation

- Changed areas: corrected schema-18 default instance labels to bind RichText
  `schematicName` rather than the emitted designator; retained a
  schematic/netlist-only fallback with no internal-ID display; made the
  designator optional/read-only; reduced Properties to one Schematic label
  entry; and tightened formal Cell Ports to their terminal-name-only
  projection. The v17 reader migration preserves ordinary label placement while
  rebinding it and removes redundant formal-Port projections.
- Validation: focused unit contracts (9 files / 78 tests), focused Playwright
  lifecycle/import/property flows (5 tests), workspace typecheck, Prettier,
  Markdown-link validation, test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: ready to commit on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux`.

## 2026-08-21 - Unified Port naming and RichText presentation

- Changed areas: added explicit Free Net Port versus Formal Cell Pin insertion;
  bound their visible text to `Net.name` or `CellTerminal.name`; introduced a
  same-text-only RichText annotation override; routed character edits through
  Net/hierarchy rename transactions; exposed role-correct Properties; and
  documented the protocol in ADR 0033. Also restored canonical formatting of
  one fixture exposed by branch verification.
- Validation: focused unit contracts (6 files / 72 tests), complete hierarchy
  browser specification (9 tests), repaired gate regressions (2 files / 18
  tests), typecheck, docs, test-impact and diff checks, plus complete
  `pnpm verify:branch` (162 unit files / 975 tests, workspace build, production
  preview smoke) passed.
- Commit status: ready to commit on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux`.

## 2026-08-21 - Schematic lifecycle mainline gate closure

- Changed areas: fixed Clipboard paste to allocate a unique
  `schematicReference` alongside each fresh netlist designator; aligned Port,
  Net RichText, connected-deletion, and Project persistence browser contracts
  with the accepted schema-18 behavior.
- Validation: Clipboard unit tests (1 file / 8 tests), all 14 originally
  failing browser cases, typecheck, test-impact and diff checks, and canonical
  `pnpm ci:check` passed with 162 unit files / 975 tests, all workspace builds,
  release/MCP smoke checks, and 167 browser tests.
- Commit status: ready to commit on `codex/schematic-instance-lifecycle-ux`.

## 2026-08-21 - Free Net Port lifecycle

- Changed areas: reused the deterministic named-Net planner for Free Port
  insertion; pruned an unreachable local Net only after its final endpoint,
  display label, and all durable references have gone; and repaired the
  browser insertion helper for the separate Port setup dialog.
- Validation: focused lifecycle/named-Net tests (9 tests), three targeted
  browser Port flows, workspace typecheck, Prettier, test-impact, and diff
  checks passed.
- Commit status: committed and pushed on `codex/insert-unification` as
  `65580820`.

## 2026-08-21 - Top-Cell Port and Net semantics

- Changed areas: enabled Formal Cell Pin authoring in the top Document; made
  Free Net Ports validated, non-emitting Net markers; assigned formal terminal
  names before anonymous Net generation; and accepted ADR 0034 with current
  interaction, export, and hierarchy guidance.
- Validation: netlist package (3 files / 19 tests), complete hierarchy browser
  spec (10 tests), focused manual Port browser flows (2 tests), typecheck,
  format/docs/test-impact, workspace build, and `pnpm verify:branch` (162 test
  files / 977 tests plus production preview smoke) passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/top-cell-port-net-semantics` as
  `60d52ebb`; stacked integration is tracked separately.

## 2026-08-21 - Unified Port semantics stack

- Changed areas: stacked top-Cell formal-interface and Free Port export
  semantics onto the unified Insert/Port Setup and Free Port Net lifecycle;
  retained the top-level Free Port default while exposing both explicit roles
  in every Document.
- Validation: focused unit tests (5 files / 29 tests), combined Port browser
  flows (5 tests), typecheck, format/docs/test-impact/diff checks, and complete
  `pnpm verify:branch` (164 files / 986 tests, workspace builds, production
  preview smoke) passed.
- Commit status: integrated as `dff2568c` and closed by `b891998e` on
  `codex/insert-unification`.

## 2026-08-21 - Imported Net routing guidance

- Changed areas: advanced Project persistence to schema 19; replaced
  document-wide flightline dismissal with per-Net `authored`/`spice-import`
  provenance; extracted a pure routing-guidance MST; renamed the geometry-only
  route mutation to `remove_route_geometry`; and added focused/all/hidden
  imported-guidance display with per-Net highlight suppression.
- Validation: focused schema/protocol/SPICE/derived/edit-engine tests,
  imported guidance browser tests (5), complete workspace unit-test execution
  after schema-baseline updates, typecheck, static/doc/reference checks,
  generated Agent/MCP artifact checks, workspace build, production preview
  smoke, test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/spice-import-routing-guidance` as
  `60ff3692`; stacked coordination is tracked separately.

## 2026-08-21 - Port and imported-routing-guidance stack

- Changed areas: stacked schema-19 imported-only routing guidance above the
  unified Port/export lifecycle; resolved the ADR 0034 collision as ADR 0035;
  preserved imported provenance through Port Net merge/delete; and hid
  guidance controls when an authored canvas has no derived guides.
- Validation: focused cross-layer unit tests, 8 combined Port/guidance browser
  flows, typecheck, format/docs/test-impact, Agent API and MCP generated checks,
  and complete `pnpm verify:branch` (165 files / 991 tests, workspace builds,
  production preview smoke) passed.
- Commit status: routing source stacked as `85cf56ec`; coordinated repair is
  committed as the current `codex/insert-unification` branch HEAD.

## 2026-08-21 - Named power and MOS bulk hotfix

- Changed areas: made VDD/AVDD/DVDD Rails ordinary named Net projections;
  unified VDD Port/Rail reuse and Razavi net-name text; and removed MOS-polarity
  fallback creation of global VDD/0 while retaining explicit and configured
  cell-default bulk connections.
- Validation: focused unit/browser tests, generated Agent/MCP artifact checks,
  test-impact and diff checks, plus canonical `pnpm ci:check` passed with
  165 unit files / 990 tests, all builds/release checks, and 169 browser tests.
- Commit status: ready to commit on `codex/vdd-named-power-hotfix`.

## 2026-08-21 - Advisory validation gate planning

- Changed areas: added a versioned validation-gate catalog, explainable diff
  planner, executable preflight/affected commands, target-plan Gate Review,
  shared changed-path collection, and an advisory GitHub Actions summary;
  existing required jobs and the canonical full delivery gate remain intact.
- Validation: planner/governance tests (2 files / 16 tests), representative
  path plans, `pnpm gate:preflight`, `pnpm gate:affected` (166 files / 1001
  tests, builds and production smoke), frozen install, and final canonical
  `pnpm ci:check` (166 files / 1002 tests, all build/release checks, 169 browser
  tests) passed, plus diff/status checks.
- Commit status: committed on `codex/gate-planning-preflight`; mainline
  integration is tracked by the branch PR.

## 2026-08-22 - Repeated Formal Port markers

- Changed areas: advanced Project persistence to schema 20; let one formal
  Cell terminal own multiple ordinary Port markers on one Net; routed Formal
  marker copy through the existing Project structural transaction; and made
  subset deletion retain the interface while final deletion keeps caller
  protection.
- Validation: 149 focused cross-layer tests, 63 Agent-adapter tests, the full
  hierarchy browser suite, generated Agent/MCP checks, test-impact,
  `pnpm verify:branch` (165 files / 992 tests plus builds and production
  smoke), and canonical `pnpm ci:check` with 170 browser tests passed.
- Latest-Main integration: preserved the variable-resistor child Cell from
  PR 138 and updated its two formal marker fields to schema 20.
- Commit status: ready to commit on `codex/named-power-bulk-semantics`.

## 2026-08-21 - Two-terminal variable resistor component

- Changed areas: added a reviewed variable-resistor Symbol that composes the
  existing vertical resistor body with one diagonal adjustment arrow; exposed
  it as a two-port Passive whose first placement creates one reusable
  parameterized child Cell; and bound instances as `X` calls so export emits a
  real `.subckt` body rather than a parent-level resistor primitive. Runtime
  and Agent catalogs were regenerated; Library coverage was brought in sync,
  and the gate's rich-text selection was made cross-platform.
- Validation: focused tests (8 files / 58 tests), hierarchy/export rerun (2
  tests), repaired overbar E2E, symbol/Agent/MCP generated checks, typecheck,
  test-impact, docs and diff checks, plus canonical `pnpm ci:check` (166 unit
  files / 995 tests, all builds and release checks, 169 browser tests) passed.
- Commit status: completed on `codex/variable-resistor` across the feature,
  subcircuit, and final gate-closure commits.

## 2026-08-21 - Centered click-to-edit rectangle labels

- Changed areas: object-anchor resolution now targets drafting rectangles
  (`@icm/derived` anchor lookup); render-svg paints object-anchored drafting
  text vertically centered on the resolved anchor; new editor
  `features/drafting/rectangle-label` module plus canvas double-click flow
  create/reopen one centered label per rectangle on empty interior space; the
  inline rich-text editor mirrors the committed alignment.
- Validation: focused unit tests (derived, render-svg, editor drafting and
  text-editing: 31 files / 155 tests), full drafting Playwright suite (27
  passed including the new scenario), repository typecheck, test-impact,
  and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/block-diagram-authoring` at the
  user's direction; mainline merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - Logic-gate and comparator symbol family

- Changed areas: added six reviewed behavioral block Symbols on the op-amp
  mechanism (inverter, AND, OR, NAND, NOR in a new Logic Gates palette
  category; comparator in Analog Blocks) with hand-composed Razavi-style
  assets, catalog entries with manual-only netlist reasons, regenerated
  runtime/Agent/MCP catalogs, shapes-panel labels, and updated
  count/coverage contracts including the browser Library suite.
- Validation: symbol/Agent/MCP/agent-api generator checks, focused unit
  tests (20 files / 103 tests incl. a new family contract test), full
  component-insert Playwright suite (21 passed), repository typecheck,
  test-impact, and diff checks passed; all six symbols placed and visually
  inspected in the running editor.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/block-diagram-authoring` at the
  user's direction; mainline merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - Directional marquee and native text-selection fix

- Changed areas: canvas suppresses native browser text selection (the cause
  of "distant labels" highlighting during drags) with an overlay restore;
  box-selection extracted to a pure marquee-selection module implementing
  left-to-right window (full containment) vs right-to-left crossing (overlap)
  with distinct live-preview styling; editor-interaction spec updated; one
  browser test's marquee gesture widened for window semantics.
- Validation: 19 new unit tests (64 across selection/canvas/wiring), full
  manual-editor/drafting/hierarchy Playwright suites, typecheck, prettier,
  markdown links, test-impact, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/marquee-window-crossing`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - Junction dots ignore collinear overlapping arms

- Changed areas: `contactRequiresJunctionDot` counts distinct route-arm
  directions (terminals keep per-pin counting), removing the phantom dot a
  duplicate overlapping route painted at a wired pin; connectivity spec dot
  clause sharpened; first direct contact-evidence test suite added.
- Validation: new contact.test.ts (6 tests), derived + render-svg suites,
  typecheck, prettier, markdown links, test-impact, and diff checks passed;
  behavior confirmed live in the editor.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/junction-dot-collinear-arms`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - Visual golden refresh and release-gate wiring

- Changed areas: regenerated the stale `fixtures/visual-golden/
{phase-3-crossing,phase-5-dense-analog}.svg` from current `main`
  (d8a813a8) after tracing every delta to accepted merged changes —
  9a552d32 removed the legacy ports layer and in-symbol instance labels and
  replaced the phase-5 input project; later bound-display/rich-text,
  canonical route geometry/contact, and collinear-arm dot (PR #144) work
  finished the drift; wired `node scripts/visual-golden.mjs --check` into
  `release:verify:built` (so `ci:check`, `ci:release`, and the CI Release
  contracts job now fail on golden drift) and classified the script in the
  gate catalog's release group.
- Validation: fresh renders diffed element-by-element against both stale
  goldens with per-delta commit attribution; `node scripts/visual-golden.mjs
--check` passes post-regeneration; prettier, markdown-link, test-impact,
  and diff checks passed. pnpm is unavailable on this machine, so the
  canonical mainline gate is delegated to the remote required checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/peaceful-poitras-f8ccde`; mainline

## 2026-08-21 - Document style overrides (schema 21)

- Changed areas: schema-21 `presentation.styleOverrides` (five bounded scale
  factors) with ADR 0038 and the rolling 20->21 upgrade; single
  overrides-aware profile resolution in @icm/derived consumed by derived
  geometry, render-svg, and the editor; `set_presentation_style` extended
  (set/keep/clear, undoable); Draw-menu Document style dialog; fixtures,
  bundled examples, agent-api/MCP artifacts, and version documentation
  updated.
- Validation: full unit suite (172 files / 1057 tests), new Playwright
  document-style scenario, typecheck, prettier, markdown links,
  export-golden, agent-api/MCP generator checks, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/document-style-overrides`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - User-saved Library examples

- Changed areas: new origin-local `user-examples-store` (own IndexedDB
  database, canonical Project text, protocol re-parse on read), Examples
  panel "My examples" section with open/export/delete, File-menu
  "Save as Example", persistence-spec classification plus two corrected
  schema-version sentences.
- Validation: store and panel unit contracts, one Playwright scenario, full
  unit suite (173 files / 1064 tests), typecheck, prettier, markdown links,
  test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/user-examples`; mainline merge gated
  on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - Always-open insert picker list

- Changed areas: removed the Insert dialog's collapse toggle and picker
  open/close state so the catalog list is permanently visible and survives
  selection; taller list cap; double-clicking an option applies it
  immediately; layout-stability e2e rewritten for the always-open contract
  plus a new double-click scenario.
- Validation: component-insert unit suite (10 files / 40 tests), full
  component-insert Playwright suite (22 passed), typecheck, prettier,
  test-impact, diff checks; verified live.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/insert-picker-always-open`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - Bundled-example promotion path

- Changed areas: new `scripts/promote-example.mjs` plus testable
  registration codemod in `scripts/lib/example-promotion.mjs` (exported
  Project -> validated canonical asset + registry entry in one command);
  bundled-example test refactored to per-example contracts so promotions
  cannot break a frozen count or single-document assumption.
- Validation: codemod tests, refactored examples suite, end-to-end smoke
  promotion (then reverted), typecheck, prettier, markdown links,
  test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/example-promotion`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-21 - Community gallery phase G1 (public feed foundation)

- Changed areas: new `GalleryDO` + `/api/gallery*` Worker surface
  (publish-first storage with admin recycle bin, bin-only hard delete,
  hashed-IP quotas, rolling-window re-serialization, server-rendered
  previews); site lands on a full-screen gallery feed at `/` with the
  editor at `/editor` and entry deep links at `/g/<id>`; bundled examples
  double as starter tiles; new community-gallery spec and platform roadmap
  (G1-G4); root workspace deps for the Worker with hand-maintained
  lockfile links.
- Validation: worker suite on in-memory SQLite (8 contracts), feed
  component tests, new gallery Playwright spec, complete Playwright suite
  (179 passed) after the `/editor` landing sweep, typecheck, prettier,
  markdown links, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/community-gallery`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Bundled tiles only while the gallery is empty

- Changed areas: gallery feed gates its bundled starter tiles on the
  community list being empty, removing the duplicated wall after the first
  real entries; populated-feed e2e expectation flipped.
- Validation: gallery Playwright spec (4 passed), feed unit tests,
  typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-bundled-fallback`; mainline

## 2026-08-22 - Editor UI declutter and adjustable-passive fixes

- Changed areas: Library drops the Recent fold and renames the virtual VDD
  Rail entry to Power Rail; the Insert dialog stops echoing the selected
  name; the floating startup recovery notice is gone (File menu keeps the
  recovery entry); the Draw dropdown becomes an always-visible horizontal
  toolbar and the left rail keeps only panel toggles; Inverter/NOR vertices
  pull back by their miter overshoot so gate bodies stop spiking into the
  negation bubbles; variable-resistor becomes an ordinary R primitive
  (removing the generated child-Cell path that made it unplaceable inside
  its own Cell) and gains variable-capacitor/variable-inductor siblings;
  Port placement loses its setup modal, with the role carried by the Library
  entry (new Cell Pin item) and names generated then edited on canvas;
  Net Port rename now runs planEnsureNamedNet so same-name Ports join one
  Net.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (172 files / 1063 tests), full
  Playwright suite (175 passed), prettier, markdown links, references,
  agent-kit/MCP/visual-golden drift checks; every changed interaction was
  exercised in a running editor. pnpm is unavailable locally, so the
  canonical ci:check is delegated to the remote required checks.
- Commit status: four commits on `claude/editor-ui-declutter`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Gallery return button and one product name

- Changed areas: explicit "<- Gallery" control at the far left of the
  document toolbar (one-click return to the landing feed); every
  user-visible "(Interactive) Circuit Maker" string — editor header,
  help/about dialogs, page title, PWA manifest — renamed to Analog Canvas.
- Validation: gallery Playwright spec (4 passed incl. click-through),
  App/component unit suites (18), typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff
  checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-back-button`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 — In-editor Publish to Gallery (admin-gated bridge)

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-publish-dialog/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: File > "Publish to Gallery…" dialog publishes the live Project
  through the documented submissions endpoint with the owner passphrase
  (session-remembered, forgotten on 401); outcome-specific messages for
  201/401/413/429/400/network. Roadmap G1 notes the in-app surface.
- Files: `features/editor-shell/gallery-publish.ts(.test.ts)`,
  `publish-gallery-dialog.tsx(.test.tsx)`, `App.tsx`, `styles.css`,
  `e2e/gallery.spec.ts`, roadmap.
- Validation: 5 unit tests, gallery Playwright spec 5/5, typecheck,
  prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-publish`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 — Hotfix: publish dialog endpoint path

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-submissions-hotfix/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: the publish client now posts to `/api/gallery/submissions`
  (was `/api/gallery`, a 404 surfacing as "rejected (not-found)" on a
  correct form — user-reported in production); the e2e mock is pinned to
  the real path so drift fails the test.
- Validation: gallery-publish unit tests, publish e2e scenario, prettier,
  test-impact, diff checks; production re-publish verified after deploy.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-submissions-path`.

## 2026-08-22 - Inductor scale reconciled with the other passives

- Changed areas: the inductor generator now emits `inductor-compact` beside
  the calibrated `inductor`, scaling the same manifest-pinned PDF vector
  evidence by a derived 2/3 `pinSpanScale` so L matches R and C at a 40-unit
  pin span; `inductor` keeps its evidence-exact geometry, fidelity target,
  and existing Instances but is renamed "Large Inductor" and made
  manual-only; the `spice:L` mapping and the SPICE importer's symbol choice
  move to the compact Symbol; `variable-inductor` was rebuilt on the compact
  base; new `inductorCompactDevice`, palette, label-side, and catalog
  wiring. No reference evidence, measurement, or manifest hash was touched.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (174 files / 1074 tests), full
  Playwright suite (179 passed), generator/catalog/agent-kit/MCP/
  visual-golden/references/markdown drift checks; rendered bounds measured
  in the running editor (R, C, compact L, variable L all 40 tall; large L
  60).
- Commit status: completed on `claude/inductor-scale-normalization`;
  mainline merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 — Publish dialog facelift and author memory

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-publish-dialog-facelift/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: publish dialog rebuilt as a single-column modern card (stacked
  full-width fields, inline optional hints, primary action) after user
  feedback on the borrowed insert-picker shell; author byline now
  persists in localStorage and prefills the next publish.
- Validation: 6 unit tests, gallery Playwright spec 5/5 unchanged,
  visual check, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/publish-dialog-facelift`.

## 2026-08-22 — Gallery phase G2: accounts and sign-in (dark-shipped)

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-auth-g2/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: `AuthDO` (migration v4) behind `/api/auth/*` — GitHub/Google
  OAuth, Resend magic links, hashed HttpOnly sessions, `ADMIN_EMAILS`
  per-request super-admin, rename, logout; gallery accepts an admin
  session wherever the bearer worked; feed header account UI (dark until
  a provider secret exists); publish dialog goes passphrase-free on an
  admin session and prefills the author byline from the account name;
  deploy workflow syncs the new secrets when present.
- Files: `worker/auth.ts(.test.ts)`, `worker/gallery.ts(.test.ts)`,
  `worker/index.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `cloudflare.yml`,
  `components/account.tsx(.test.tsx)`, `gallery-feed.tsx`,
  `gallery-publish.ts(.test.ts)`, `publish-gallery-dialog.tsx(.test.tsx)`,
  `App.tsx`, `styles.css`, `e2e/gallery.spec.ts`, spec + roadmap.
- Validation: worker suites 18, editor unit sweep 92, gallery Playwright
  8/8, typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-auth-g2`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 — Fixed and variable capacitor plate semantics

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-capacitor-plate-semantics/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: device descriptors now assign stable top/bottom plate roles to
  fixed capacitor pins `1/2` and variable-capacitor pins `P1/P2`; Project JSON,
  Symbol artwork, and SPICE syntax/order remain unchanged.
- Validation: focused device/SPICE/netlist tests (18), static contracts and
  typecheck, affected gate (178 unit files / 1105 tests and 124 browser tests),
  test-impact, formatting, documentation, MCP projection, and diff checks.
- Commit status: completed locally; remote mainline delivery remains gated.

## 2026-08-22 — Axis-aware Power Rail and VDD Port labels

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-vdd-rail-port-presentation/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: retained generic `Power Rail`/`Rail` naming and named-Net behavior;
  GUI and Agent author horizontal or vertical rails, endpoint resize follows
  the active axis with live preview, tapped movement stays connected, and
  automatic VDD Port labels remain upright/clear through orientation changes
  without overriding user-moved labels.
- Validation: focused unit and browser tests, static contracts and typecheck,
  affected gate (178 unit files / 1105 tests and 124 browser tests),
  test-impact, formatting, documentation, MCP projection, and diff checks.
- Commit status: completed locally; remote mainline delivery remains gated.

## 2026-08-22 — Capacitor plate facts in Properties

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-capacitor-plate-properties/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: selected fixed and variable capacitors now show read-only Top/Bottom
  plate rows with stable Pin names and current named Net, unnamed Net ID, or
  unconnected state; no instance override or Project protocol field was added.
- Validation: focused unit/browser checks, static contracts and typecheck,
  affected unit gate (179 files / 1108 tests), editor browser gate (91 tests),
  test-impact, formatting, and diff checks.
- Commit status: completed locally; remote mainline delivery remains gated.

## 2026-08-22 — Razavi logic-gate family alignment

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-razavi-logic-gate-alignment/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: extracted hash-pinned native textbook vectors for inverter, AND,
  NAND, NOR, and XOR; generated reviewed OR/XNOR compositions; registered all
  seven gates in the runtime, GUI, Agent catalog, and MCP resources; added a
  symbol-only fidelity runner without restoring the retired scene pipeline.
- Validation: deterministic 11/11 evidence regeneration and wrong-source
  rejection; direct hard IoU inverter 0.7172, AND 0.9326, NAND 0.8301, NOR
  0.9064, XOR 0.9101; generator/catalog drift checks; focused and affected
  gates; canonical CI passed 1097 unit and 183 browser tests on an isolated
  local port, with release verification and production smoke.
- Commit status: completed on `codex/razavi-logic-gate-alignment`; remote
  required checks pending.

## 2026-08-22 — Logic-gate continuity and scale follow-up

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-razavi-logic-gate-continuity-scale/plan.md`
  (completed).
- Change: corrected vertical PDF lead endpoint selection for NAND/inverter and
  restored source-weight negation bubbles, closing visible lead/body and
  body/bubble gaps; retained the measured family scale after a common-canvas
  NAND/inverter/MOS/resistor/capacitor comparison.
- Validation: deterministic 11/11 extraction; direct hard IoU inverter 0.8018,
  NAND 0.9180, NOR 0.9417; generator drift and focused geometry tests; affected
  gates; canonical CI passed 1099 unit and 183 browser tests.
- Commit status: completed on `codex/razavi-logic-gate-alignment`; remote
  required checks pending.

## 2026-08-22 - SKY130 external MOS presentation

- Changed areas: reused explicit four-terminal Razavi NMOS/PMOS artwork for
  reviewed SKY130 external definitions; added an atomic Model-field transition
  between ordinary `M` model binding and external `X` binding; exposed `nf`
  without converting retained `m`; and preserved generic-block fallback.
- Validation: focused symbol/planner/import/editor tests, `gate:preflight`,
  `gate:affected` (167 files / 1018 unit tests plus all selected browser
  suites), frozen install, and canonical `pnpm ci:check` with builds, release
  checks, production smoke, and 171 browser tests passed.
- Commit status: ready to commit on
  `codex/sky130-external-mos-presentation`.

## 2026-08-22 - SKY130, logic-gate, VDD, and capacitor integration

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-sky130-logic-vdd-cap-stack/plan.md` (completed).
- Changed areas: stacked the completed VDD/capacitor, Razavi logic-gate, and
  SKY130 external-MOS work on latest `main`; retained the existing device,
  external-subcircuit, named-Net, routing, and symbol/catalog boundaries; and
  updated the SKY130 browser scenario to the current `/editor` route.
- Validation: Razavi drift checks; 177 focused tests; affected browser gates;
  branch verification with 1120 tests/build/smoke; frozen install and canonical
  `pnpm ci:check` with 185 browser tests; all six GitHub checks passed on PR
  #159 before close-out.
- Commit status: delivered to `codex/sky130-logic-vdd-cap-stack`; PR #159 open
  for review, superseding closed draft PR #141.

## 2026-08-22 — Examples toggle and bundled circuit additions

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-examples-toggle-and-circuits/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: Examples now collapses when its active rail button is clicked again;
  added bundled Current-Mirror-Loaded Differential Pair and Fully Differential
  Two-Stage Op Amp Project cards.
- Validation: focused unit/browser checks, preflight, and affected gate
  (1108 unit tests; 22 component-insert and 91 manual-editor browser tests).
- Commit status: committed locally on `codex/examples-toggle-and-circuits`.

## 2026-08-22 — Examples mainline delivery

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-merge-examples-main/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: rebased the completed Examples feature on current `origin/main`,
  retaining concurrent plan-log entries without changing product behavior.
- Validation: preflight against `origin/main`, frozen dependency install, and
  canonical `pnpm ci:check`; the full Playwright run recorded `passed` with no
  failed tests.
- Commit status: rebased review branch is ready for required GitHub checks and
  merge to remote `main`.

## 2026-08-22 — Hotfix: auth fetch seam Illegal invocation

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-auth-fetch-binding/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: `AuthDO.fetchLike` was the raw global fetch; `this.fetchLike()`
  rebinds `this` in the Workers runtime ("Illegal invocation"), so every
  OAuth exchange failed as the generic sign-in error while Node tests
  passed. Arrow-wrapped the seam, switched the GitHub token exchange to
  form-encoding, added an identity regression test.
- Validation: worker suites, typecheck, prettier, test-impact; production
  GitHub sign-in verified after deploy.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/auth-fetch-binding`.

## 2026-08-22 - Editor chrome pass from a live review

- Changed areas: both left panels lose the "QUICK PLACE" title banner (and
  its dead CSS); Publish to Gallery moves out of the File menu to a menubar
  button beside Search; the brand mark plus wordmark becomes a two-way
  editor/gallery switch (the gallery's brand now links to the editor); the
  Library panel gains a dragged, clamped, persisted width through
  `useEditorPanels` and a keyboard-operable `col-resize` separator; the
  Document style dialog is rebuilt on the publish dialog's card with one
  settings row per knob and a Reset/Done footer.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (179 files / 1121 tests), full
  Playwright suite (185; one unrelated current-marker drag flake passed on
  re-run), prettier, markdown links, diff checks; every surface verified in
  a running editor including a real 248→368px handle drag.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/drop-panel-title-banner`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 — Gallery phase G3: review queue with quality gates

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-review-g3/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: shared `evaluateSubmissionGates` (@icm/derived) — zero ERC
  errors, zero floating endpoints (wire / named net / NoConnect), no
  near-empty projects — enforced in the worker (422) and previewed
  blocking in the publish dialog; ordinary signed-in submissions enter
  `pending` until a reviewer approves or rejects with a stored optional
  reason; in-app moderator appointment by email; `/review` and `/mine`
  pages; feed account links; root workspace gained `@icm/derived`.
- Validation: gates 5, worker 47, editor units 31, full unit sweep 1132,
  gallery Playwright 10/10, typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff
  checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-review-g3`; mainline merge

## 2026-08-22 - Example import, square palette tiles, paste marker references

- Changed areas: clicking a Library example now attaches its content to the
  placement cursor as an ordinary clipboard payload instead of replacing the
  Project (hierarchical examples still open as their own Project behind the
  dirty guard); palette tiles became fixed squares in an auto-fill grid so a
  wider panel fits more per row; the Publish button dropped its ellipsis; and
  paste now allocates a free reference for schematic-only markers, fixing the
  `Duplicate netlist instance reference: PWR1` rejection that a second example
  import (or an ordinary copy of a ground/power port) triggered.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (179 files / 1121 tests), full
  Playwright suite (185 passed), prettier, diff checks; example import, tile
  squareness, and panel resizing all exercised in a running editor.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/publish-label-clarity`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Named differential input swap and one shared brand

- Changed areas: new role-driven `hasDifferentialInputs` projection in
  `@icm/derived`; instance properties offer "Swap + / − inputs" for op amps
  and comparators, issuing the existing top/bottom reflection so marks and
  terminals move together; the gallery brand adopts the editor's markup,
  classes, and typography, links to the editor, and the editor's brand
  truncation is scoped to the editor chrome so the gallery shows the full
  wordmark.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (180 files / 1133 tests), full
  Playwright suite (187 passed), prettier, diff checks; the swap and both
  brands verified in the running app.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/differential-input-swap`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Differential-output op amp and independent output swap

- Changed areas: the op-amp generator now derives `opamp-differential` and
  `opamp-differential-crossed` from the same pinned PDF vector evidence (body
  truncated where the reviewed triangle edges reach the ±10 output height,
  output marks reflected about the body centerline); both are reviewed palette
  entries; instance properties gained "Swap + / − outputs", which exchanges
  the two Symbols through the existing `set_instance_symbol` edit so terminal
  names and attached Nets survive.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (181 files / 1135 tests), full
  Playwright suite (187 passed), generator/catalog/agent-kit/MCP/visual-golden/
  references drift checks, prettier, diff checks; both Symbols and the swap
  verified in the running editor.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/differential-output-opamp`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Unified copy placement transforms

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-unified-copy-transform/plan.md` (completed).
- Changed areas: made copy ghost rendering inspect the same dry-run edit
  transaction used by commit; replayed secondary rotate/reflect commands in
  input order; corrected already-oriented object-label projection; and adapted
  the browser assertion to the ghost's reserved copy ID.
- Validation: focused clipboard/orientation unit tests, focused copy-preview
  browser workflow, `pnpm ci:static`, preflight, and diff checks passed.
- Commit status: committed locally on `codex/unified-transform-power-bulk`;
  remote mainline delivery remains gated.

## 2026-08-22 - Canonical Port label transform follow-up

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-unified-copy-transform/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: canonical free-Port Net labels now recover their single upright
  reference placement after rotation or mirroring, including copy secondary
  operations; partial formal-Port ghosts omit Cell-interface metadata outside
  the fragment.
- Validation: focused clipboard/Edit Engine tests, static contracts, preflight,
  test-impact, and affected unit/component/hierarchy/editor browser gates.
- Commit status: committed locally as `06772ef5`; remote mainline delivery
  remains gated.

## 2026-08-22 - Explicit Ground placement policy

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-ground-placement-policy/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: a user-placed Ground explicitly grounds an ordinary contacted Net by
  merging into `0` or canonicalizing it; conflicting supply domains remain
  rejected.
- Validation: focused planner/placement tests, static contracts, preflight,
  test-impact, and affected unit/component/hierarchy/editor browser gates.
- Commit status: committed locally as `eccaef21`; remote mainline delivery
  remains gated.

## 2026-08-22 - Stable MOS bulk defaults

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-mos-bulk-defaults/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: the first explicit Ground, VDD Port, or named Power Rail persists an
  unset stable-ID NMOS/PMOS default; Properties exposes those choices without
  overriding explicit or no-connect B decisions.
- Validation: focused planner/derived/browser tests, static contracts,
  preflight, test-impact, and affected unit/component/hierarchy/editor browser
  gates.
- Commit status: committed locally as `4fc49714`; remote mainline delivery
  remains gated.

## 2026-08-22 - Bundled Example MOS bulk semantics

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-example-mos-bulk-semantics/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: repaired only the missing MOS body facts in the two bundled
  differential Examples by recording their existing VDD/0 defaults, B
  terminals, and `cell-default` bindings; added a per-Example unresolved-bulk
  ERC regression.
- Validation: live editor `Issues (0)` for both fixtures; focused Example and
  bulk tests; focused Example browser workflow; static contracts, preflight,
  test-impact, and affected unit/component/hierarchy/editor gates.
- Commit status: committed locally as `bd5bc67e`; mainline delivery proceeds
  through the canonical local and remote gates.

## 2026-08-22 - Publish button spells out its destination

- Changed areas: the menubar publish control reads "Publish to Gallery"
  instead of "Publish"; the redundant aria-label is dropped now that the
  visible text carries the full action. CI caught that the longer label
  pushed the right-hand chrome past a 720px viewport, so the menubar now
  shrinks and scrolls its own row under 900px; with it able to yield, the
  editor's truncation moved off the brand link onto the project/document
  line, leaving both views with a pixel-identical 22px mark and an untruncated
  wordmark.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (181 files / 1135 tests), full
  Playwright suite (187 passed), prettier, markdown links, diff checks; brand
  geometry measured in both views.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/publish-full-label`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - One chrome band across both views

- Changed areas: the gallery header adopts the editor's menubar height and
  padding; every gallery header control (owner badge, account links and
  buttons, sign-in summary, primary action) sits on the shared control
  height; the brand block in both views spans that same band, so each
  header's two sides are equal and the two headers match each other.
- Validation: typecheck, full unit suite (182 files / 1148 tests), full
  Playwright suite (186 passed; the recurring component-insert:376 timing
  flake passed on its isolated re-run), prettier, diff checks; header, brand,
  and button geometry measured in both views.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-header-band`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Insert dialog dismissal gap behind a recurring "flake"

- Changed areas: Escape now dismisses an open Insert dialog from the window
  handler. The dialog focuses its search field a frame after opening and its
  own Escape handler sits on the dialog form, so an Escape pressed in that gap
  left the dialog open with its backdrop swallowing later pointer actions —
  the cause of the `component-insert.spec.ts:376` failures that had looked
  like a timing flake all session. The spec's incidental coverage is replaced
  by a deterministic test that moves focus out of the dialog before pressing
  Escape.
- Validation: typecheck, the spec file three times end to end, the new test
  re-run with the fix stashed to prove it fails without it, editor unit tests
  (419), full Playwright suite (188 passed), prettier, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/fix-copy-mode-flake`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Placement ghosts seeded from the last pointer position

- Changed areas: the canvas remembers its last pointer position, and both the
  copy and component placement paths seed their preview from it, so a
  placement started from the keyboard shows its ghost at the cursor instead of
  waiting for the next pointer move.
- Validation: typecheck, editor unit tests (419), full Playwright suite (189
  passed), the new test re-run with the fix stashed to prove it fails without
  it, prettier, diff checks; reproduced and re-verified in a running editor.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/seed-placement-preview`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 — Gallery masonry feed (G4 first slice)

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-masonry/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: replaced the CSS multi-column wall with a true masonry
  component (equal-width columns, natural tile heights, greedy
  shortest-column placement with left-to-right reading order, one
  ResizeObserver relayout on resize/image load); owner picked it from
  side-by-side renderings of the live entries.
- Validation: component suite 13, gallery Playwright 11/11 (new
  placement scenario), typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-masonry`.

## 2026-08-22 - One annotation text house style

- Changed areas: `semanticTextDocument` and `defaultDraftTextDocument` now
  share one rule — capitalized italic leading symbol, remainder as its
  subscript — replacing the `V*`/`I*` shorthand and the role-specific
  instance-label regex. Subscripts stay upright except supply designators
  (DD/SS/CC/EE/BB), carried as a nested italic span because the renderer
  already honors that as a deliberate override. A trailing polarity sign stays
  outside the subscript, and a value containing whitespace stays prose so a
  drafting note is not swallowed into one long subscript.
- Historical documents need no migration: bound annotations are pure
  projections re-derived on read by `resolveAnnotationText`.
- Validation: full unit suite (1155), full Playwright suite (189 passed),
  visual and export golden `--check` both clean (goldens carry `Vin+`/`Vout`,
  which the superseded rule split identically), typecheck, prettier, diff
  checks; rendered output inspected per glyph for VDD/VSS/VCC/Vin/Vout/Iout/
  CLK/A and both drafting cases.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/semantic-text-subscripts`; mainline
  merge gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 — Gallery chrome everywhere and owner editing

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-owner-editing/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: shared `GalleryChrome` on every state of the feed, `/mine`,
  and `/review` (no more bare edge-touching paragraphs); `PUT
/api/gallery/<id>` — reviewers update any entry in place, ordinary
  owners update through the gates and re-enter review with the previous
  decision cleared; publish dialog gains an update-vs-new mode; `/mine`
  cards show previews, open-in-editor links, and resubmission guidance.
- Validation: worker gallery 13, unit sweep 472, gallery Playwright
  13/13, typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-owner-editing`.

## 2026-08-22 — Gallery feed G4 remainder

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-feed-g4/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: list gains an `author` filter before keyset paging; the feed
  pages via an IntersectionObserver sentinel and filters by clickable
  bylines (URL-carried, clearable); `/review` gains the admin recycle
  bin (restore, confirm-guarded delete-forever).
- Validation: worker gallery 14, component units 28, gallery Playwright
  16/16, typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-feed-g4` (stacked on
  `claude/gallery-owner-editing`).

## 2026-08-22 — Gallery circuit tags

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-tags/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: one tag normalization through submit/update/list/aggregate;
  `?tags=a,b` OR-union filter; `GET /api/gallery/tags` counts; publish
  dialog chip editor with presets and update-mode prefill (tags editable
  any time via the owner-update path); feed multi-select tag menu with
  clickable tile chips.
- Validation: worker gallery 15, editor units 54, gallery Playwright
  17/17, typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-tags` (stacked on
  `claude/gallery-feed-g4`).

## 2026-08-22 - Library category order and Bulk action reach

- Changed areas: `CATEGORY_ORDER` now runs Transistors, Passives, Power and
  Ports, Sources, Switches, Analog Blocks, Logic Gates — display order only,
  no category membership change. The MOS bulk section moved to the head of the
  selection panel and now leads with an accented "Draw bulk connection" button
  instead of trailing its two default-Net selects.
- Validation: component-insert unit tests (47), Playwright component-insert +
  manual-editor specs (117 passed), typecheck, prettier, diff checks; both
  changes confirmed in a running editor.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/library-order-and-bulk`; mainline merge

## 2026-08-22 - Repeating a Cell Pin name places another marker

- Changed areas: new `planAttachCellPortMarker` appends a Port Instance to an
  existing terminal's `interfaceInstanceIds` and merges the marker's Net into
  the terminal's Net; placement routes through it instead of aborting with
  `Cell port X already exists`. The model already typed `interfaceInstanceIds`
  as a plural array, so no schema change was needed.
- Kept one terminal per name deliberately: `connectivity-index.ts` and
  `schema/project.ts` resolve a parent Instance's pin to a child terminal by
  name, so two same-named terminals would resolve ambiguously to the first
  match. Rename-onto-an-existing-name still rejects (ambiguous between "one
  pin" and a typo) but now names the working alternative.
- Validation: full unit suite (1162), edit-engine + component-insert (221),
  Playwright hierarchy spec (12 passed) including the new placement case,
  typecheck, prettier, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/duplicate-pin-names`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Steering the wire corner from the drafting gesture

- Changed areas: `WireCornerOrder` gained `horizontal-first`/`vertical-first`,
  `appendOrthogonal` honors them over the inherited incoming direction, and
  `compileWireDraft` now threads a step's corner order through its orthogonal
  branch (it was previously dropped). Middle-click while drafting cycles the
  corner shape — horizontal-first, vertical-first, 45° diagonal — replacing a
  binding that only reached the diagonal.
- Already worked, now covered: double-click finishes a wire while single click
  continues it (`onDoubleClick` → `applyWireCanvasPoint(finish=true)`;
  pointer-down ignores `detail !== 1`). Confirmed in a running editor.
- Deliberately not done: free-angle segments. `validateRoute` rejects any
  non-octilinear Route, so arbitrary angles change an enforced geometry
  invariant rather than a drafting option and need a spec/ADR decision.
- Validation: full unit suite (1169), full Playwright suite (199 passed)
  including a new corner-geometry spec, typecheck, prettier, diff checks.

## 2026-08-22 — Examples panel reads the community gallery

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-examples-from-gallery/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: the Examples panel lists the same gallery as the landing feed
  and opens entries through the shared `/g/<id>` path (arming publish
  update mode); bundled starters remain the offline/empty fallback.
  Production data: the two missing bundled examples seeded with tags and
  the two original seeds retagged — all four starters now in the gallery.
- Validation: editor-shell units 26, gallery Playwright 18/18, existing
  examples e2e 2/2, typecheck, prettier, test-impact, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/examples-from-gallery`.

## 2026-08-22 — Hotfix: gallery pages scroll inside their shell

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-gallery-scroll-fix/plan.md` (completed).
- Change: the editor locks #root/body with overflow hidden, so the
  gallery pages had no scroll container — .gallery-shell/.review-shell
  now scroll themselves (height 100%, overflow-y auto), which also
  revives below-the-fold lazy previews; new e2e pins the shell as the
  scroller.
- Validation: gallery Playwright 18/18, prettier, test-impact, diff
  checks; production verification after deploy.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/gallery-scroll-fix`.

## 2026-08-22 - A Power Rail stays straight and resizes from its ends

- Fixed the reported "rail length cannot be changed": the rail's end handle is
  drawn under the Junction's `endpoint-hit` circle, and the capture-phase
  `handleCanvasHitPointerDown` skipped handles by testing only `event.target`
  — the topmost element — so it claimed the press and translated the rail.
  It now ranks the whole element stack at the point. Reproduced first (both
  ends moved +100, status "Moved Power Rail"), fixed, re-verified.
- The existing rail-resize e2e passed throughout because it connects a wire
  first, which removes the covering endpoint circle; real usage never starts
  from that state.
- Added the missing invariant: `validateRoute` now requires a whole connected
  rail run to be collinear, not just each stored Route. A wire drawn from a
  rail endpoint inherits `presentation: "power-rail"`, so a perpendicular
  branch previously produced a bent rail from two straight halves. Collinear
  extension still succeeds.
- Historical data is not silently straightened: the transaction layer
  grandfathers pre-existing route errors on unchanged geometry, so a bent
  Project still opens but any edit touching that rail must leave it straight.
- Validation: full unit suite (1170) with the new case re-run against a
  stashed invariant to prove it fails without it, full Playwright suite (200
  passed), typecheck, prettier, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/power-rail-straight`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - The canvas text editor stops clipping long labels

- Reproduced the reported "text box cannot show everything" on a Port's
  right-aligned label: typing a longer name gave `scrollHeight 40` against
  `clientHeight 36` with `overflow: visible`. The overlay is a
  `foreignObject`, which clips silently, so the wrapped line was neither
  visible nor scrollable.
- Cause: `resolveCanvasTextEditorFrame` sizes the frame from the committed
  bounds — before the longer name exists — and its height floor budgeted one
  line. It now budgets three, and `.rich-text-editable` gained
  `max-height: 100%` with `overflow-y: auto` so anything past the frame
  scrolls instead of vanishing.
- Validation: measured `scrollHeight === clientHeight` afterwards for 3-, 26-
  and 33-character names, with a 400-character extreme scrolling; full unit
  suite (1172), full Playwright suite (203 passed), the new e2e case re-run
  against a stashed fix to prove it fails without it; typecheck, prettier,
  diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/text-editor-clipping`; mainline merge
  gated on the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Dragging a marquee selection that holds no Instance

- Reproduced the reported intermittent "marquee then drag does nothing": two
  standalone wires, marquee across both (status "Selected 6 objects", both
  Routes marked `selected`), drag one — only the grabbed Route moved (dy 70
  against dy 0) and the status read "Moved loose route", a single-object move.
- Cause: `compositeSelectionOwnsHit` required `selectedIds.length > 0`, and
  `selectedIds` holds only Instances, so a marquee with no Instance never
  counted as composite and the press fell through to the single-object
  branches. A Junction hit only re-selected itself, which reads as the drag
  doing nothing. That is what made it intermittent — it worked whenever the
  selection happened to include an Instance.
- Fix: count a composite selection across every kind, and when it owns the hit
  without an Instance to anchor the move, fall back to
  `beginVisualSelectionMoveFromSelection` guarded by `planSelectionMove`, the
  same pattern the existing route-tap path uses.
- Validation: full unit suite (1172), full Playwright suite (204 passed), the
  new e2e case re-run against a stashed fix to prove it fails without it
  (Expected 70, Received 0); typecheck, prettier, diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `claude/marquee-drag`; mainline merge gated on
  the remote required checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Canonical MOS presentation for SKY130 calls

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-sky130-canonical-mos-mapping/plan.md` (completed).
- Changed areas: reviewed SKY130 external calls now reuse canonical
  `nmos`/`pmos` symbols through import, Model-field switching, definition
  synchronization, and Insert, while preserving external X binding and ordered
  D/G/S/B export; incompatible external definitions keep the generic block.
- Validation: focused contracts (64), preflight, affected units (1171),
  hierarchy Playwright (12), manual-editor Playwright (93), branch verification,
  workspace build, production smoke, test-impact, and diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `codex/sky130-canonical-mos-mapping`.

## 2026-08-22 - Local named VDD Port netlist export

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-vdd-port-local-net-export/plan.md` (completed).
- Changed areas: net-marker extraction now applies the global-Net requirement
  only to Ground; a VDD Port accepts an explicitly named local or global
  `powerDomain: vdd` Net, emits no marker record, and rejects named non-VDD
  Nets. The deterministic export specification now records the same policy.
- Validation: focused netlist contract (17), preflight static/type/docs and
  test-impact checks, affected workspace units (1173), and diff checks.
- Commit status: completed on `codex/sky130-canonical-mos-mapping` as a stacked
  fix after the canonical SKY130 MOS commit.

## 2026-08-22 - Junction dots follow visible conductor directions

- Changed areas: contact evidence now classifies a visible Junction dot from
  distinct Route-arm and terminal-stem directions instead of adding terminal
  objects to Route direction counts; three-or-more coincident terminals remain
  an explicit dot rule. Removed the unused raw Route-arm count and aligned the
  connectivity specification and Junction-role comment.
- Protected cases: three collinear MOS Gates stay electrically connected but
  dotless at the middle Gate; true perpendicular taps, three-way and 45-degree
  branches remain dotted; right-angle terminal exits, rotation, and mirroring
  use the same direction protocol.
- Validation: focused derived tests (12), focused Playwright regression (1),
  preflight/static/typecheck, full affected unit suite (1177), hierarchy
  Playwright (12), project-file Playwright (8), and workspace build passed.
- Commit status: completed on `codex/junction-visible-directions`; mainline
  delivery remains gated on the canonical local and remote checks.

## 2026-08-22 - Stacked SKY130, VDD export, and Junction mainline delivery

- Target: `plan/2026-08-22-stack-sky130-vdd-junction-mainline/plan.md`
  (completed).
- Changed areas: rebased the canonical SKY130 MOS and local named VDD export
  commits onto `origin/main@dff17f82`, then stacked the Junction
  visible-direction commit. Only additive plan-log conflicts required manual
  resolution; no new model, binding, routing, or persistence protocol was
  introduced during integration.
- Validation: focused union units (78) and Junction browser case (1), preflight,
  affected units (1185), hierarchy (12), project-file (8), manual-editor (98),
  frozen dependency install, and canonical `ci:check` including build, release
  smoke, and all 205 browser tests.
- Commit status: stacked review branch prepared for required remote checks and
  one PR merge to `main`.

## 2026-08-23 - Separate project properties from selection

- Target: `plan/2026-08-23-properties-project-split/plan.md` (completed).
- Changed areas: split Properties into Selection and Project views; moved
  Placement Tray and live Issues into Project; simplified issue filters to
  severity only; compacted identity, primitive target, parameter, capacitor,
  and direct wire-action presentation without changing the MOS Bulk section.
- Validation: preflight; affected unit suite (183 files / 1185 tests);
  component-insert Playwright (24), hierarchy Playwright (12), manual-editor
  Playwright (98); workspace build; isolated local-browser view check; diff
  checks.
- Commit status: committed locally as `da6e15d2` on
  `codex/properties-project-split`; pending push and remote required checks.
